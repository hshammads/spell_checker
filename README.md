# spell checker
This is a spell checker that can fix strings given in terminal and from an input file.
NOTE: The input file has to be in the same directory as the script.

The program gives the option to be run in debug mode and whether you would like to use an input file.
If input file is not selected, then the program will ask for an input phrase.
The program will review the phrase and output the corrected phrase.
NOTE: The program does not save corrected phrases in memory. It only displays them in terminal.

If input file is selected, then the program will run through all the phrases, separated in new lines, and fix them.
The program does save the corrected phrases from input file into an output file, in the same directory.

Enjoy!!

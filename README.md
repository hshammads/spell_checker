# spell checker
This is a sample project.
It has two prompts for testing.
One prompt is a list, and the other is a string.
The program takes each input, manually, and fixes spelling for each word, outputting the corrected versions.

Future steps:
1. Automate input and take it from a file as a parameter or a string directly from terminal
2. Set up debug statements, that also gets set from user input
3. Set up try and catch blocks
4. Set up program to update the input file
